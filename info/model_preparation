MODEL PREPARATION
Before we proceed to the next steps, it's necessary that you prepare your models. One of the challenges at this point is dealing with very high resolution models; they make the scene sluggish and the files big.
This add-on makes it easy and efficient: you only have to create two separate .blend files, each of them containing a different version of the model that will be linked to the final file. This way loading times to open the files and working with the model will be much faster, and your high resolution model only needs to be stored in a single heavy file, instead of being present in every version of the final model you save.
Let's check the steps to follow:
1. Create a .blend file and import your high resolution model.
2. Apply all modifiers to avoid issues later on.
3. Save the file and make a copy: this will be an optimized version of your high resolution model (proxy).
4. Through applying decimate modifiers you'll get a much lower resolution version which you'll work with, making the experience smoother.
5. From this add-on, you will define the .blend files assigned to the high resolution and proxy models.
6. You can now click on "Bring models to the scene" and you'll be set up with the proxy version of your model.
7. Now you can move, rotate, scale, or parent the objects of the proxy model, as it's quicker and less heavy. At any time you can just swap the proxy with the high resolution model and viceversa. This is useful to link low resolution model (the final one that goes to the videogame) with high resolution model before exploding it and performing the bakes.
IMPORTANT NOTE: To be able to swap the proxy and high resolution models, all of the objects need to keep their original names, otherwise they won't work.

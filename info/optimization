OPTIMIZATION
When working for videogames, you usually have to work within a "polygon budget". For the game to run smoothly, the number of polygons of each prop and character have to be limited.

Optimization is the part of the process in which you take the model from retopo, and "clean" it so the number of polygons ends up within the limit.

It's usually measured in triangles, as it's the minimum number of sides that a polygon can have, and this way you have a more reliable number to work with.

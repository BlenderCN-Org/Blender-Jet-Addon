SMOOTHING & SHARPENING
After you have the final geometry for your model, it's time to define how that geometry looks like. To do that, we use Smoothing and Sharpening.

Basically, you'd have to define which parts of the geometry are smooth, and then choose which edges would be sharp (corners).

The steps to follow we suggest to perform this part of the process are:
1. Smoothing everything.
2. Set autosmooth as enabled and setting it to 180 degrees (this will make your model completely smooth, while showing the desired edges as sharp).
3. Marking desired edges a sharp.

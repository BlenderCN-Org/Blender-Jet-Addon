RETOPOLOGY
The first stop once we have our high resolution model ready is to generate a lower resolution model that resembles the high resolution shape. This process is known as "Retopology" or "Retopo", and it consists on creating a new topology (geometry surface) on top of the high resolution model.

There are many specific techniques, tricks, tools... but the main 3 ways in which you'll generate the new mesh are:
    1. Reusing the high resolution model: taking subdivisions away and deleting unnecessary geometry (like support loops), decimating (in the case of a sculpt without subdivisions, for example) or merging elements.
    2. Using the snap tools to model while the new mesh is automatically projected on the original (very common and especially useful with organic models.
    3. Modeling on top of the original shape to create similar shapes (but keeping the control that snapping takes away - useful for hard-surface models).
